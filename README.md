# Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL - Active Edge Magisk Module for Edge Sense Plus

Replaces the SystemUIGoogle.apk that hosts the Elmyra (Active Edge) service with a modified version.
It hooks into the squeeze events and forwards it to the app Edge Sense Plus which provides tons of different actions to choose.
You will also have a long squeeze and a double squeeze gesture, as well as seperate squeeze gestures based on what position the device is,
like flat on the table or in landscape mode.
