# Pixel 2/XL and Pixel 3/XL - Active Edge Magisk Module for Edge Sense Plus

![Edge Sense Plus](https://img.xda-cdn.com/MES6opinXpBdhGjoqHaaP6YuOow=/http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FZscjQRD.png)

Replaces the SystemUIGoogle.apk that hosts the Elmyra (Active Edge) service with a modified version.
It hooks into the squeeze events and forwards it to the app Edge Sense Plus which provides tons of different actions to choose.
You will also have a long squeeze and a double squeeze gesture, as well as seperate squeeze gestures based on what position the device is,
like flat on the table or in landscape mode.

<br/>

### Minimum Requirements

Android Pie 9.0

Magisk module will always just support the last five security patch levels. 
Compatible versions for older patch levels can be flashed from [GitHub](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/active_edge_system_mod/releases)
	
### Attention

Ensure have a current TWRP backup ready.
The module replaces the GoogleSystemUIGoogle.apk that could lead to a non booting device.
You can always also just run the MagiskUninstaller and flash Magisk again afterwards to get out of a bootloop.
